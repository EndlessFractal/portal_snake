# Portal Snake

Portal Snake takes the timeless concept of the snake game and adds a whole new dimension to it. 

# How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
- The snake will wrap around the screen boundaries.
- The goal is to eat the blue food items and avoid colliding with the snake's body.
- Each time the snake eats a food item, its length will increase, and your score will be incremented.
- The game ends when the snake collides with its own body.

# AI Control

Feeling overwhelmed? Don't worry! Portal Snake features an AI assistance mode that takes control of the snake. Sit back and watch as the AI calculates the optimal path to the food items, showcasing its strategic prowess. You can even toggle AI control on the fly, seamlessly switching between manual and AI-guided gameplay.

- Press the letter V (as in Viper) to toggle AI control.
- When AI control is enabled, the snake will automatically find the shortest path to the food using a BFS algorithm.
- The snake will move towards the food, avoiding collisions with its own body.

*Please note that the AI controlling the snake in this game has a quirky sense of priorities. It's not perfect and may have a slight obsession with food. While it excels at finding and devouring delicious treats, it may occasionally overlook the snake's own survival in pursuit of a tasty morsel. Proceed with caution, keep an eye on your snake's well-being, and remember to prioritize self-preservation over culinary cravings. Bon app√©tit, and good luck!*
